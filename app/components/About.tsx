            As a Computer Engineer with a strong foundation from the University of Peradeniya 
            and ongoing graduate studies at the University of Colombo, I've dedicated my career 
            to building systems that matter. My journey has taken me from developing encrypted 
            video streaming platforms to architecting critical backend infrastructure for 
            leading OTT services like NOW TV.

          <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            What sets me apart is my ability to remain calm under pressure while leading 
            teams through complex technical challenges. At Surge Global, I served as both 
            the emotional and technical backbone, guiding clients through critical decisions 
            and ensuring successful product delivery. This experience taught me that great 
            engineering isn't just about code—it's about communication, collaboration, and 
            unwavering commitment to excellence.

            My work spans cloud infrastructure migrations that delivered significant cost 
            savings, CI/CD pipeline optimizations that reduced release failures, and 
            on-call rotations where I've resolved production issues with precision and 
            urgency. I thrive in environments where reliability and scalability are 
            non-negotiable, and I bring that same rigor to every project I touch.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Beyond technical expertise, I believe in being a core team player dedicated 
            to achieving project goals. Whether it's mentoring junior engineers, 
            collaborating with cross-functional teams, or taking on leadership roles 
            like my tenure as President of the Hackers' Club at UOP, I'm committed to 
            fostering environments where everyone can excel.
